## Overview

The `audio_noise` detector analyzes audio quality to detect background noise, distortion, and other audio issues that may affect content quality. It uses signal processing techniques to evaluate signal-to-noise ratio and audio clarity.

**No configuration required** - This detector works with default settings.

## Configuration

This detector does not require any configuration parameters. Include it with an empty config object:

```json
{
  "detector_name": "audio_noise",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "detector_name": "audio_noise",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Result Schema

```json
{
  "detector_name": "audio_noise",
  "pass_check": true,
  "score": 0.8,

## Audio Quality Metrics

- **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** - Higher values indicate cleaner audio
- **Noise Level** - Categorized as low, medium, or high
- **Audio Quality** - Overall assessment: excellent, good, fair, poor
- **Dynamic Range** - Difference between loudest and quietest parts
- **Clarity Score** - Overall audio clarity from 0.0 to 1.0

## Common Noise Types Detected

- **background_hum** - Low-frequency electrical or mechanical noise
- **wind_noise** - Outdoor recording wind interference  
- **room_echo** - Reverberation in recording environment
- **compression_artifacts** - Digital compression-related distortion
- **clipping** - Audio signal exceeding recording levels
- **static** - Random electrical interference

## Detector Type

**HEURISTIC** - Uses signal processing algorithms for audio analysis
