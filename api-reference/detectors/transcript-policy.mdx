## Overview

The `transcript_policy` detector analyzes video transcripts against policy guidelines, checking for required talking points and flagging language that should be avoided. It uses OpenAI with fallback to keyword matching for comprehensive policy compliance.

**Requires at least one configuration parameter** - Either `talking_points` or `language_to_avoid` must be provided.

## Configuration

<ParamField body="config.talking_points" type="array">
  List of required talking points or topics that should be mentioned
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="config.language_to_avoid" type="array">
  List of prohibited words, phrases, or topics that should not appear
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="config.min_talking_points" type="integer">
  Minimum number of talking points that must be mentioned (default: all provided points)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="config.max_language_to_avoid" type="integer">
  Maximum number of violations from language_to_avoid list before failing (default: 0)
</ParamField>

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "detector_name": "transcript_policy",
  "config": {
    "talking_points": [
      "product benefits",
      "how to use the product",
      "results or effectiveness"
    ],
    "language_to_avoid": [
      "competitors",
      "negative reviews",
      "side effects",
      "medical claims"
    ],
    "min_talking_points": 2,
    "max_language_to_avoid": 1
  }
}
```

## Interpreting Results

The transcript_policy detector analyzes transcript content against policy guidelines and returns:

- **Talking Points** - Array showing which required topics were found with supporting text examples
- **Language to Avoid** - Analysis of prohibited words or phrases with any violations identified  
- **Policy Summary** - Count of talking points found vs. required and violations found vs. allowed
- **Compliance Score** - Overall adherence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on requirements met
- **Text Examples** - Specific transcript segments that match talking points or contain prohibited language
