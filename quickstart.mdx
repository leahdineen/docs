## 1. Get Your API Key

Contact your administrator to obtain an API key for authentication.

## 2. Create Your First Judge

Create a judge to evaluate content based on your criteria:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.judge.example.com/judges \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Content Quality Judge",
    "description": "Evaluates content for clarity and accuracy",
    "content_type": "text",
    "criteria": [
      {
        "name": "Clarity",
        "description": "How clear and understandable the content is"
      },
      {
        "name": "Accuracy",
        "description": "Factual correctness of the information"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

data = {
    "name": "Content Quality Judge",
    "description": "Evaluates content for clarity and accuracy",
    "content_type": "text",
    "criteria": [
        {
            "name": "Clarity",
            "description": "How clear and understandable the content is"
        },
        {
            "name": "Accuracy",
            "description": "Factual correctness of the information"
        }
    ]
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.judge.example.com/judges",
    headers=headers,
    json=data
)

judge = response.json()
print(f"Created judge: {judge['id']}")
```

</CodeGroup>

Save the judge ID from the response - you'll need it for evaluations.

## 3. Upload Content

Upload text content to evaluate:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.judge.example.com/content/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "text_content=This is a sample article about artificial intelligence and its applications in modern business." \
  -F "name=AI Article" \
  -F "file_type=text"
```

```python Python
import requests

files = {
    'text_content': (None, 'This is a sample article about artificial intelligence and its applications in modern business.'),
    'name': (None, 'AI Article'),
    'file_type': (None, 'text')
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.judge.example.com/content/upload",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"},
    files=files
)

content = response.json()
print(f"Uploaded content: {content['content_id']}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## 4. Evaluate Content

Submit your content for evaluation:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.judge.example.com/evaluations/single \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content_id": "cnt_abc123",
    "judge_id": "jdg_xyz789"
  }'
```

```python Python
data = {
    "content_id": content['content_id'],
    "judge_id": judge['id']
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.judge.example.com/evaluations/single",
    headers=headers,
    json=data
)

evaluation = response.json()
print(f"Started evaluation: {evaluation['evaluation_id']}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## 5. Get Results

Retrieve the evaluation results:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.judge.example.com/evaluations/eval_def456 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import time

# Wait for evaluation to complete
time.sleep(10)

response = requests.get(
    f"https://api.judge.example.com/evaluations/{evaluation['evaluation_id']}",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Overall Score: {result['overall_score']}")
print(f"Summary: {result['summary']}")
```

</CodeGroup>
