## Overview

The `framing` detector evaluates shot composition and framing quality in video content. It detects common framing issues like subjects being too close or far, off-center positioning, insufficient headroom, cropped subjects, and distracting composition elements.

**No configuration required** - This detector works with default settings.

## Configuration

This detector does not require any configuration parameters. Include it with an empty config object:

```json
{
  "detector_name": "framing",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "detector_name": "framing",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Result Schema

```json
{
  "detector_name": "framing",
  "pass_check": false,
  "score": 0.6,
  "rationale": "Multiple framing issues detected including subject too close and off-center positioning",

        "rationale": "Subject is positioned too close to camera and off-center in frame"
      },
      {
        "frame_index": 420,
        "decisions": ["insufficient_headroom"],

## Interpreting Results

- **decisions**: Array of detected framing issues for each flagged frame
- **frame_index**: Specific frame number where issues were detected
- **too_close**: Subject positioned too close to camera
- **too_far**: Subject positioned too far from camera
- **off_center**: Subject not properly centered in frame
- **insufficient_headroom**: Not enough space above subject's head
- **cropped_subject**: Parts of subject cut off by frame edges
- **distracting_composition**: Background elements that distract from main subject
