## Overview

Evaluates speech clarity and background noise levels in the audio.

## Configuration

This detector does not accept configuration keys.

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "detector_name": "audio_noise",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Result Schema

```json
{
  "detector_name": "audio_noise",
  "pass_check": true,
  "score": 0.86,
  "rationale": "Good SNR: 18.4 dB. Low music overlap: 6.0%",
  "metrics": {
    "snr": {
      "snr_db": 18.4,
      "speech_rms": 0.12,
      "noise_rms": 0.03,
      "usable_noise_duration_sec": 8.2,
      "min_snr_db_threshold": 12.0,
      "pass": true
    },
    "music": {
      "overlap_pct": 0.06,
      "yamnet_available": true,
      "detail": "ok",
      "max_overlap_threshold": 0.3,
      "music_score_threshold": 0.4,
      "pass": true
    },
    "speech_segments_count": 14,
    "total_speech_duration_sec": 22.5
  },
  "timestamps": [],
  "flagged_frames": [],
  "execution_time_sec": null,
  "api_cost_usd": null
}
```

## Interpreting Results

- **snr.pass/music.pass**: Individual checks that determine the overall pass/fail result.
- **snr_db/overlap_pct**: Primary quality signals for speech clarity and music overlap.
- **speech_segments_count/total_speech_duration_sec**: How much speech was detected.
