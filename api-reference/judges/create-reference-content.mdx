```

## Response

<ResponseField name="upload_url" type="string">
  A pre-signed GCS (Google Cloud Storage) URL for uploading the reference content. 
  
  This URL is valid for a limited time (typically 5 minutes) and should be used with a PUT request to upload the file directly.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="reference_content_uri" type="string">
  The GCS URI where the file will be stored. This can be used to reference the file in subsequent API call to create a judge.
  
  **Format:** `gs://bucket-name/path/to/file`
</ResponseField>

## Response Example

```json
{
  "upload_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/judge-artifacts/org_123/reference_uploads/abc123/xyz789.mp4?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=...",
  "reference_content_uri": "gs://judge-artifacts/org_123/reference_uploads/abc123/xyz789.mp4"
}
```

## How to Upload Content

After receiving the response, use the `upload_url` to upload your file:

```bash
curl -X PUT "<UPLOAD_URL_FROM_RESPONSE>" \
  -H "Content-Type: video/mp4" \
  -T your-file.mp4 \
```


## Important Notes

1. The upload URL expires after a limited time (typically 5 minutes)
2. The file must be uploaded using a PUT request
3. Set the appropriate `Content-Type` header when uploading
4. The `reference_content_uri` returned should be used to reference this content when creating a judge
