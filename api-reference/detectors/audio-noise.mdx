## Overview

The `audio_noise` detector analyzes audio quality to detect background noise, distortion, and other audio issues that may affect content quality. It uses signal processing techniques to evaluate signal-to-noise ratio and audio clarity.

**No configuration required** - This detector works with default settings.

## Configuration

This detector does not require any configuration parameters. Include it with an empty config object:

```json
{
  "detector_name": "audio_noise",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "detector_name": "audio_noise",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Result Schema

```json
{
  "detector_name": "audio_noise",
  "pass_check": true,
  "score": 0.8,
  "rationale": "Audio quality is good with minimal background noise detected",

## Interpreting Results

The audio_noise detector returns key audio quality metrics:

- **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** - Higher values indicate cleaner audio, with 20+ dB being acceptable
- **Noise Level** - Categorized as low, medium, or high based on background noise presence
- **Audio Quality** - Overall assessment ranging from excellent to poor
- **Overall Clarity** - Score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating audio clarity and listening experience
- **Noise Segments** - Specific time ranges where noise issues occur with severity ratings
