## Overview

The `framing` detector evaluates shot composition and framing quality in video content. It detects common framing issues like subjects being too close or far, off-center positioning, insufficient headroom, cropped subjects, and distracting composition elements.

**No configuration required** - This detector works with default settings.

## Configuration

This detector does not require any configuration parameters. Include it with an empty config object:

```json
{
  "detector_name": "framing",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "detector_name": "framing",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Result Schema

```json
{
  "detector_name": "framing",
  "pass_check": false,
  "score": 0.6,
  "rationale": "Multiple framing issues detected including subject too close and off-center positioning",

## Common Framing Issues Detected

- **too_close** - Subject is positioned too close to the camera
- **too_far** - Subject is positioned too far from the camera
- **off_center** - Subject is not properly centered in the frame
- **insufficient_headroom** - Not enough space above the subject's head
- **cropped_subject** - Parts of the subject are cut off by the frame edges
- **distracting_composition** - Background or composition elements that distract from the main subject

## Detector Type

**AI_VISION** - Uses OpenAI Vision API for framing analysis
