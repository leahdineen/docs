## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format with appropriate HTTP status codes:

### Success Response Example

## Webhooks

Many asynchronous operations support webhook notifications. Configure your webhook URL in your organization settings to receive real-time updates about:

- Evaluation completion
- Processing errors
- Status changes

Webhook requests include an `X-Webhook-Signature` header for request validation using HMAC-SHA256 with your organization's webhook secret.
