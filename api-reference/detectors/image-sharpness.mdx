## Overview

Evaluates whether a still image is sufficiently sharp.

## Configuration

This detector does not accept configuration keys.

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "detector_name": "image_sharpness",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Result Schema

```json
{
  "detector_name": "image_sharpness",
  "pass_check": true,
  "score": 0.78,
  "rationale": "Image appears sharp enough for large-format printing",
  "metrics": {
    "base_score": 31.2,
    "downscaled_score": 28.7,
    "crop_score": 27.4,
    "min_sharpness_score": 20.0,
    "min_downscaled_sharpness": 18.0,
    "upscaled_score": 24.5,
    "min_upscaled_sharpness": 22.0
  },
  "timestamps": [],
  "flagged_frames": []
}
```

## Interpreting Results

- **base_score/downscaled_score/crop_score**: Core sharpness measurements used for pass/fail.
- **min_* thresholds**: The minimum scores required to pass.
- **upscaled_score**: Included only when upscaling checks are enabled.
