## Introduction

The Judge API provides programmatic access to create and manage content evaluation judges, and submit content for evaluation.

## Base URL

```
https://api.judge.app
```

## Authentication

The API supports two authentication methods:

### API Key Authentication

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" https://api.judge.app/v1/endpoint
```

### Bearer Token Authentication (Auth0 JWT)

Include your JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" https://api.judge.app/v1/endpoint
```

Note: Some endpoints support both authentication methods, while others require specific authentication. Check each endpoint's documentation for details.

## Rate Limits

API rate limits vary by endpoint and organization tier. Contact support for information about your specific limits.

## Webhooks

Many asynchronous operations support webhook notifications. Configure your webhook URL in your organization settings to receive real-time updates about:

- Evaluation completion
- Processing errors
- Status changes

Webhook requests include an `X-Webhook-Signature` header for request validation using HMAC-SHA256 with your organization's webhook secret.
