## Overview

The `background` detector analyzes the background and setting of video content to assess environment quality, cleanliness, and appropriateness. It specifically determines if content is filmed inside a car and evaluates background tidiness and professionalism.

**No configuration required** - This detector works with default settings.

## Configuration

This detector does not require any configuration parameters. Include it with an empty config object:

```json
{
  "detector_name": "background",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "detector_name": "background",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Background Analysis

### Environment Types
- **Indoor Studio** - Professional setup with controlled lighting
- **Home Setting** - Residential environment, bedroom, living room
- **Outdoor Location** - External environments, natural settings
- **Car Interior** - Vehicle-based filming location
- **Office/Workspace** - Professional work environment
- **Retail/Commercial** - Store or commercial location

### Tidiness Assessment
- **Excellent** - Extremely clean and organized
- **Good** - Well-maintained with minor items
- **Fair** - Somewhat cluttered but acceptable
- **Poor** - Messy, disorganized, distracting

### Professionalism Levels
- **High** - Studio-quality, brand-appropriate setting
- **Medium** - Clean, presentable environment
- **Low** - Basic but acceptable background
- **Poor** - Unprofessional or inappropriate setting

## Car Detection

### Car Environment Analysis
- **Vehicle Type** - Sedan, SUV, truck identification
- **Interior Quality** - Clean vs. cluttered car interior
- **Safety Considerations** - Driving vs. stationary recording
- **Audio Quality** - Road noise and acoustic challenges
- **Lighting Conditions** - Natural light vs. interior lighting

### Car-Specific Metrics
- **Dashboard Visibility** - Car controls and branding
- **Seat Position** - Driver vs. passenger positioning
- **Background Movement** - Static vs. moving environment
- **Audio Interference** - Engine noise, road sounds

## Quality Factors

### Visual Appeal
- **Color Harmony** - Cohesive color scheme
- **Lighting Quality** - Even, flattering illumination
- **Composition** - Well-framed background elements
- **Brand Alignment** - Appropriate for content type

### Distraction Assessment
- **Clutter Level** - Amount of background items
- **Movement** - Distracting background activity
- **Inappropriate Items** - Objects that don't fit content
- **Competing Elements** - Background items that draw attention

### Brand Appropriateness
- **Professional Standards** - Meeting brand image requirements
- **Content Alignment** - Background matches content type
- **Audience Suitability** - Appropriate for target demographic
- **Platform Compliance** - Meeting platform content guidelines

## Common Background Issues

- **Messy/Cluttered** - Disorganized items and spaces
- **Poor Lighting** - Inadequate or unflattering illumination
- **Inappropriate Items** - Objects that don't match content
- **Distracting Elements** - Background items that compete for attention
- **Unprofessional Setting** - Environments unsuitable for brand content

## Use Cases

- **Content Quality** - Ensuring professional appearance standards
- **Brand Guidelines** - Meeting specific background requirements
- **Platform Compliance** - Adhering to platform content standards
- **Audience Appropriateness** - Ensuring suitable environments for target demographics

## Detector Type

**AI_VISION** - Uses OpenAI Vision API for environmental analysis and scene understanding
